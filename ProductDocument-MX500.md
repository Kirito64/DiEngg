## 1. ⚡ Electrical and Power Architecture

* **Power Configuration**:

  * The MX-500 operates on a **3-phase, 415V, 50Hz** AC power system. Industrial-grade wiring rated above 16A should be used.
  * Ensure the power line is equipped with **RCCB and surge protection**.

* **Power Consumption**:

  * Max draw of **15 kW** during peak load conditions (e.g., rapid axis travel + spindle at full speed).
  * Load distribution: \~45% spindle motor, \~35% servo drives, \~20% auxiliary systems.

* **Battery Backup**:

  * A **3.6V Lithium-Ion non-rechargeable cell** maintains volatile memory (tool offsets, settings).
  * Memory backup time: \~72 hours with full charge.

* **Earthing & Grounding**:

  * Use **star grounding** with <2 ohms earth resistance.
  * Avoid common ground paths for control and power lines to reduce noise coupling.

## 2. 🟢 Startup and Power-On Sequence

* **Step-by-Step Sequence**:

  1. **Main Breaker** energizes power distribution board.
  2. **Control Relay Activation** engages PLC and HMI subsystems.
  3. Siemens 828D loads **PLC logic, MMI, servo parameters**, and initializes safety circuits.
  4. Home return executed via G28/G53 macro or HMI softkey.

* **Precautions**:

  * Delay of 15 sec is necessary for power capacitors in VFD and servo drives to stabilize.
  * Interlocks (spindle clamp status, door open) must be verified before M-code execution.

## 3. 🧭 Axis & Motion System

* **Axes Overview**:

  * **X/Y/Z** are driven by **AC Servo Motors** with **0.001 mm incremental encoders**.
  * Position feedback via **closed-loop system** to eliminate drift.

* **Ball Screws & Bearings**:

  * Class C3 ground screws.
  * Double-nut preloaded design to minimize backlash.
  * Mounted with angular contact bearings with preload.

* **Max Rapid Feed**:

  * 15 m/min achieved with trapezoidal acceleration profile to prevent vibration.

* **Control Loop**:

  * Uses PID tuning + disturbance observer in Siemens drive controller.
  * **Vibration mitigation** handled via dynamic gain scheduling.

## 4. 🧰 Automatic Tool Changer (ATC) System

* **Structure**:

  * Carousel-type arm with pneumatic actuation.
  * Tool holders: BT40, pull-stud compatible.

* **Actuation Sequence**:

  1. M06 command triggers ATC macro.
  2. Tool retraction → spindle orientation → ATC arm engagement → tool swap → return.

* **Sensors**:

  * S12: Proximity sensor for tool clamp status.
  * S17: Home sensor for ATC arm alignment.

* **Pneumatics**:

  * Dry air at **6–8 bar** regulated via FRC unit.
  * Air buffer tank: 1L near ATC for consistent pressure.

* **Common Errors**:

  * **Alarm 302**: Low drawbar pressure (<4 bar).
  * **Sensor S12 Fault**: Cable break or misalignment; check 24V supply and proximity gap.

## 5. 🧪 Maintenance Protocols

| Task                | Specification                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Lubrication**     | VG68 oil, 0.3 L per reservoir fill      |
| **Air Filter**      | 5-micron pre-filter; clean with dry air |
| **Coolant**         | Emulsion mix (1:20); pH 8–9             |
| **Spindle Runout**  | Max 5 micron; test via dial indicator   |
| **Software Backup** | Use Siemens HMI backup utility on USB   |

* **Grease Points**: Ball screws and linear guides have auto-lube lines.
* **Sensors Check**: Run diagnostic screen on 828D to validate input/output state.

## 6. ❄️ Cooling and Thermal Control

* **Coolant Tank**:

  * Capacity: 80L; equipped with float switch.
  * Overfill drain connected to collection tray.

* **Coolant Type**:

  * Water-soluble oil-based cutting fluid.
  * Mixture critical to avoid microbial growth.

* **Spindle Cooling**:

  * Chiller loop integrated with spindle housing.
  * Uses Peltier or refrigeration-based closed loop system.

* **Error C55**:

  * Triggered by analog-to-digital failure in coolant sensor.
  * Check voltage (0-10V) across sensor; replace if <1V.
